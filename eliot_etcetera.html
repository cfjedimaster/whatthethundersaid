I have not had a chance to see this 1994 movie, but from what I have 
read the movie details the relationship between Eliot and his wife. James Jamison
(<a href="mailto:jjamison@slip.net">jjamison@slip.net</a>), graciously sent me this review: <br clear="left">

<blockquote>
Maurice Haigh-Wood given a major role.	
Too many patently symbolic scenes illustrative of Eliot's 
lines e.g., each in his prison, each confirms a prison.
Eliot in exalted misery. If I remember correctly, Bertrand Russell was played by 
Nicholas Grace, Anthony Blanche of "Brideshead Revisited."
